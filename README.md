__I BELIEVE NOBODY LIKES 'DIRTY WORK'!__


This is a collection of the guidance to use some tools/software/methods and their environment setting.
I created this repository to make the 'dirty work' can be easily handled. 

Now in this repository, we have the following topics:

- [Accelerating Lightweight Openpose algorithm using OpenVINO Toolkit](https://github.com/VXallset/my_readme/blob/master/Accelerating%20Lightweight%20Openpose%20using%20OpenVINO.md).

- [Install GPU version of Tensorflow 1.13/1.14/2.0 on Ubuntu 18.04](https://github.com/VXallset/my_readme/blob/master/install_tensorflow-gpu.md).
